# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

The team and community takes all security bugs in the project seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Security Issue"](https://github.com/issy62/envoy/security/advisories/new) tab.

The team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling the report. After the initial reply to your report the team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and a full annoucement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module/crate.

## Notifications

### Need to Know

These notificatios are limited-information advanced warnings that say that a new release is comming and, depending on the nature of the issue and availability of invitations, perhaps some of the following:

* affected versions
* affected platforms
* possible mitigations

> A new security vulnerabilty has been confirmed that affects envoy v1.0 and above on all platforms. A new release to fix this issue is expected in the next week.

### Public Notifications

Public notifications are a wider disclosure of vulnerabilities. Unlike the "Need to Know" notifications, these will give some information about the vulnerabilities, e.g. what features are affected, mitigation strategies, and how the vulnerability was discovered.

These annoucements will be made alongside new releases which fix the issue.
